<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The project aims to predict the stock prices of a given company using LSTM networks. It can be beneficial / it can come handy in following ways-

*	Predicting the future performance of a certain stock thereby allowing you to decide the positions you want to take ie to sell, buy or hold.
*	Selecting the industry for investment by studying the expected industry-wise market trends.
*	Acting as a tool to confirm your analysis about the movement of stock prices.
The results should not be treated as conclusive for investment and do not ensure a 100% accuracy.<br/><br/>
However, the minimum accuracy of the model is 86% which is taken to be acceptable considering the unpredictable nature of the stock market.
